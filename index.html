        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Head of Data with a senior product management background.
          I help organizations make better decisions by connecting data capabilities
          with real product and business needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          After several years as a Senior Product Manager, my focus naturally evolved
          towards data: metrics definition, experimentation, analytics and decision frameworks
          that scale beyond individual teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my current role, I lead data initiatives with a strong product mindset:
          prioritizing impact, clarity and adoption over purely technical solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work closely with product, engineering and business teams to ensure data
          is reliable, understandable and actionable at every level of the organization.
        </p>

        <p>

        <p>
          My skillset combines Data Strategy, Analytics, Product Thinking, Team Leadership,
          Experimentation and Stakeholder Management, shaped by hands-on experience
          in fast-growing digital companies.
        </p>
